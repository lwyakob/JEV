General info
JEV case data (infected humans and infected piggeries) for the 2022 Australian JEV outbreak are mapped along with all known locations of piggeries. Boundaries of varying sizes are plotted around the piggery locations and masked to WorldPop raster data to estimate those at risk of infection.

Technologies:
Python - version 3.9

Setup:
Following modules must be installed: matplotlib.pyplot ; numpy ; rasterio ; geopandas; shapely, pyproj; json; plotly

Features:

Estimating population at risk of JEV: 'JEVfinal.ipynb'

Status:
Project is: finished
